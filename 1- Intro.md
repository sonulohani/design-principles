### Introduction to design patterns

-Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that donâ€™t
- Separating what changes from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation. "Program to an interface" really means program to a supertype.
- HAS-A can be better than IS-A. Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for lossely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
